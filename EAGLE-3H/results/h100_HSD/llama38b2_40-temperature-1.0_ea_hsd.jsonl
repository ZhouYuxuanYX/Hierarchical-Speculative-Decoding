'Thrice as much' means 3 times the price.\n\nSo, if we assume the six-inch cold-cut combo costs x dollars, then 3x (thrice as much) would be the price of the other sub.\n\nHowever, in your scenario, the original order costs $40, so let's assume that's the price for the fish sub.\n\nIf the foot-long fish sub costs $40, and you want to buy the six-inch cold-cut combo sub for thrice its price, we need to know the original price (x) first. And the six-inch doesn't cost $40.\n\nIf the six-inch cold-cut combo costs x and that cost is three times the price of the foot-long cold-cut combo sub, then the six-inch (3x) isn't $40 and the fish sub isn't $40 as well for this being a hypothetical scenario.\n\n\n\nTo make this example more accurate we need more specific information.\n\n\n\nLet's make the model scenario simpler for this purpose, by assuming the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub (x) equals 1. Thus, its six-inch (3x) would then be $3 because that's thrice as much.\n\nHere's the example to calculate the total cost that a $40 foot-long fish sub plus a $3 six-inch cold-cut combo sub:\n\n1. Six-inch cold-cut combo cost: $3\n2. Foot-long Fish sub: $40\n3.
